everything in the app folder is a server-side component

folders will not be publicly accessible unless a page.tsx file is added inside of it

server components can't handle browser events (click, mouseover, etc.)
    can use 'use client' to by pass this
    better to extract the interactive part and to put it in a separate component





*** notes for me ***
collapsible dashboard - accordion component (daisyui)
